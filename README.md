## Using: Quick start

1. Create a file a name it `filename.bfed`.
  You can type in the terminal :
  ```sh
  $ touch <FILENAME>.bfed
  ```
  The program verifies the extension. Why ? Beacause it's BrainFucked ! If the extension isn't `.bfed` compiler will return an error.
  
2. Write your program. It's recommended to have a main file or a starting point for the program. Else imports may not work correctly...
 
3. Compile it ! How ? By typing :
  ```sh
  $ bfed <FILENAME>.bfed
  ```
  in the terminal and see how many error you have ;)
